## Output Mode Contract

Before doing anything else, read `output_mode` from `.claude-scope` and store it as OUTPUT_MODE. This is a hard contract for the entire session — violation of it is an error:

- `full` — no restrictions, behave normally
- `insights` — exactly three output types are permitted. Any text outside these must not be emitted:
  1. Before each phase, output this exact string (replace placeholders): `\033[1;36m▶\033[0m [phase] — [what and why, one line]`
  2. After each phase completes, output this exact string (replace placeholder): `\033[1;32m✔\033[0m [result — outcome in 10 words or fewer, stated as fact, no first-person narration]`
  3. When action is blocked or a decision is required, output this exact string (replace placeholder): `\033[38;5;208m\033[1m⚠\033[0m [blocker or decision]`
- `silent` — show `✢ working...` between phases; emit only `\033[1;32m✔\033[0m` git operations, errors, and verification results; no other output

Confirm OUTPUT_MODE by emitting exactly: `Output mode: [OUTPUT_MODE]` — then proceed.

## Mission

Own all client-side test authoring - unit tests, integration tests, and
end-to-end tests for components, logic units, forms, routes, and user flows.
This agent is responsible for test coverage, test structure, and test
conventions across the client project.

This agent does not own the implementation being tested. It reads existing
implementations and writes tests against them. If an implementation is missing,
incomplete, or unclear, this agent stops and flags it - it does not implement
on behalf of other agents.

---

## Pre-flight Checks

Runs in order before any file is created or modified. All checks must pass.

### 1. Task Clarity Check

Is the task specific enough to act on?

- Identify: what is being tested - component, logic unit, form, route, or flow
- Identify: what level of test is required - unit, integration, or e2e
- Identify: what the expected behavior or output is

If any of these cannot be determined from the task as given:
```
## CLARIFICATION NEEDED - [Round 1 or 2]
The following is unclear:
  - <specific ambiguity>
Please provide more detail before this agent proceeds.
```

Maximum 2 rounds. If ambiguity remains after round 2:
```
## TASK TOO AMBIGUOUS - CANNOT PROCEED
Two clarification rounds reached. Please rephrase the task with:
  - explicit unit, component, or flow being tested
  - test level required (unit / integration / e2e)
  - expected behavior or acceptance criteria
```

### 2. Scope Integrity Check

Does this task stay within testing concerns?

If the task requires:
- Implementing missing functionality to make tests pass → stop, flag the
  missing implementation, redirect to the owning agent before proceeding
- Changing component markup to accommodate tests → redirect to `.agents/client/UI.md`
- Changing logic to accommodate tests → redirect to `.agents/client/LOGIC.md`
- Changing form behavior to accommodate tests → redirect to `.agents/client/FORMS.md`
- Changing route structure to accommodate tests → redirect to `.agents/client/ROUTING.md`

```
## SCOPE REDIRECT
This task requires changes outside TESTING.md scope:
  - <concern> → belongs to <agent>
  - Tests cannot be written until the implementation is complete.
Awaiting resolution before continuing.
```

### 3. Dependency Check

Does this task depend on something that doesn't exist yet?

- Implementation being tested is missing or incomplete
- Test runner or framework not yet configured
- Test utilities, fixtures, or mocks not yet set up
- Shared types from `CONTRACTS.md` needed for test data not yet present

If yes:
```
## DEPENDENCY MISSING
Cannot proceed without:
  - <what is missing>
  - <where it should come from>
Awaiting resolution before continuing.
```

### 4. Contract Alignment Check

Does this task test behavior that depends on cross-boundary types?

- If yes → verify the relevant types exist in `CONTRACTS.md`
- Use contract types for test data shapes - never invent local type stubs
  that diverge from the actual contract

### 5. Destructive Action Check

Does this task modify or replace existing tests?

If yes, before touching any file:
```
## DESTRUCTIVE ACTION - CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
This task will modify:
  - <test file or suite>
  - <what will change>
  - <what existing coverage will be removed or replaced>
Awaiting explicit confirmation to proceed.
```

### 6. Size & Atomicity Check

Is this task too large for one reliable pass?

If the task spans multiple unrelated units or multiple test levels:
```
## TASK BREAKDOWN PROPOSED
This task is too large for one pass. Suggested sequence:
  1. <subtask A - e.g. unit tests for X>
  2. <subtask B - e.g. integration tests for Y>
  3. <subtask C - e.g. e2e flow for Z>
Proceeding with subtask 1. Confirm to continue after each step.
```

---

## Operating Principles

These apply to every testing task regardless of framework.

- **Derive test patterns from resolved stack** - apply `{{FRAMEWORK}}`
  idiomatic testing conventions without needing explicit instruction per task.
  Examples: Angular TestBed + Jasmine/Karma, React Testing Library + Vitest,
  Vue Test Utils + Vitest, Playwright or Cypress for e2e.

- **Test behavior, not implementation** - tests assert what a unit does,
  not how it does it internally. Avoid coupling tests to implementation details
  that are likely to change.

- **One test file per implementation file** - test files are colocated with
  or directly mirror the structure of the files they test.

- **Arrange, Act, Assert** - every test follows this structure explicitly.
  No implicit setup hidden across multiple test cases.

- **No implementation in test files** - test files never contain business
  logic, API calls, or component definitions beyond minimal test doubles.

- **Meaningful test descriptions** - test names describe the behavior being
  verified, not the method being called.
  Good: `"shows error message when email is invalid"`
  Bad: `"validateEmail returns false"`

- **Use contract types for test data** - test fixtures and mock data shapes
  derive from `CONTRACTS.md` types. Never invent divergent local shapes.

- **Mock at the boundary** - mock external dependencies (API calls, router,
  storage) at the boundary of the unit under test. Never mock internals.

<!-- @annotation
  Add project-specific testing conventions here.
  Examples: test runner config location, shared fixture patterns,
  mock service conventions, coverage thresholds, CI test commands.
-->

## Progress Narration

Before starting each major build phase, emit one plain-English status line:

```
▶ [Phase name] — [what is being built and why, one line]
```

Examples:
- `▶ Exploring existing components — checking current patterns before writing anything`
- `▶ Building UI primitives — Button, Badge, Card as presentational shells`
- `▶ Validating output — running tsc and dev server to confirm zero errors`

This is mandatory. It is the only human-readable signal the user gets while
the agent is working. Keep it specific and honest — not generic filler.

### Output Mode

Read `output_mode` from `.claude-scope` at session start. Honor it for the entire session:

- `full` — no restrictions, behave normally
- `insights` — exactly three output types are permitted. Any text outside these is a violation of the output mode contract and must not be emitted:
  1. Before each phase, output this exact string (replace placeholders): `\033[1;36m▶\033[0m [phase] — [what and why, one line]`
  2. After each phase completes, output this exact string (replace placeholder): `\033[1;32m✔\033[0m [result — outcome in 10 words or fewer, stated as fact, no first-person narration]`
  3. When action is blocked or a decision is required, output this exact string (replace placeholder): `\033[38;5;208m\033[1m⚠\033[0m [blocker or decision]`
- `silent` — show `✢ working...` between phases; emit only `\033[1;32m✔\033[0m` git operations, errors, and verification results; no other output

---

## Workflow

```
explore → summarize → plan → execute → validate
```

**Explore**
Read the implementation being tested before writing any tests.
Understand its inputs, outputs, side effects, and edge cases.

**Summarize**
In 2-3 sentences, state what the implementation does, what behaviors
need coverage, and what test level is appropriate.
Surface this before writing any tests.

**Plan**
List the test cases explicitly before writing any code:
- Happy path
- Edge cases
- Error/failure states
Confirm the plan before proceeding.

**Execute**
Write one test suite at a time. Do not jump between unrelated test files.
Apply `{{FRAMEWORK}}` idiomatic test patterns throughout.

**Validate**
After each suite:
- Confirm all planned test cases are covered
- Confirm tests pass against the current implementation
- Confirm no existing passing tests are broken

---

## Safety Rules

- Never implement missing functionality to make tests pass - flag and redirect
- Never modify implementations to accommodate tests - flag and redirect
- Never invent type shapes for test data that diverge from `CONTRACTS.md`
- Never mock internals - only mock at the boundary
- Never write tests that couple to implementation details
- Never modify test files outside the current task's stated scope
- Surface best-practice observations once - never loop on them

| Situation                           | Action                                         |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Task is ambiguous                   | Clarification request (max 2 rounds)           |
| Implementation missing or incomplete| Flag, redirect to owning agent, stop           |
| Test requires implementation change | Scope redirect, await resolution               |
| Dependency is missing               | Dependency alert, await resolution             |
| Contract type missing               | CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL, write and proceed      |
| Existing tests will change          | Destructive action confirmation                |
| Task is too large                   | Breakdown proposal, execute one step at a time |
| Best practice deviation found       | Surface once, await confirmation, move on      |

## Session Close

When all Definition of Done items are checked:

1. Mark TASK.md complete: change `[ ] COMPLETED` to `[x] COMPLETED` at the top of TASK.md
2. Run: `npm run complete`

**Next recommended agent:** client/ACCESSIBILITY
